# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis (Alfido Tech Internship Project)

Welcome to my data analysis project as part of the **Alfido Tech Internship**! This project involved diving deep into a retail dataset to uncover patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales trends—using Python and the power of data storytelling.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw transaction data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize sales trends across time, region, and product categories
- Segment customers by value and frequency
- Practice storytelling with data for business insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration

## 📁 Dataset
- File: `superstore_final_dataset (1).csv`
- Fields include: `Order_Date`, `Sales`, `Region`, `Category`, `Segment`, `Customer_Id`, and more

## ✅ Key Accomplishments
- 🧹 Resolved encoding and datetime parsing errors during file loading
- 📅 Parsed and resampled sales by month to study trends
- 📌 Built bar plots, line graphs, scatterplots, heatmaps, and time series charts
- 🧍 Identified top 10 customers by revenue and purchase frequency
- 📈 Grouped data by region, category, and segment for in-depth insights

## 🌟 Bonus Analyses
- 👥 Customer Segmentation based on total sales and order count
- 📦 Product and Sub-Category sales comparisons
- 📊 Sales vs. Profit visuals using simulated margin estimates (where applicable)

## 📸 Sample Visuals
> _Visualizations include:_  
> - Monthly Sales Trends  
> - Regional Sales Comparison  
> - Category-Level Sales Bar Charts  
> - Top 10 Customers (by name and ID)  

## 📌 What I Learned
